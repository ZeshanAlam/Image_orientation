**README for Image Orientation Correction Demo**
**Overview**
This demo script is designed to read images and their corresponding depth maps from a specified directory, correct the image orientation. The script utilizes MATLAB to perform image rotation, grayscale conversion (if necessary), and orientation correction using gradient consistency and horizontal symmetry analysis.
**Prerequisites**
•	MATLAB (The script was developed and tested on MATLAB R2021a. Compatibility with other versions is expected but not guaranteed.)
•	Image Processing Toolbox for MATLAB (for functions like imread, rgb2gray, imrotate, and imshow).
**Setup**
1.	Data Preparation: Place your  images and corresponding  depth maps in the same directory. Ensure each image has a corresponding depth map with the same filename (excluding the extension).
2.	Configuration: Update the datapath variable in the main script to point to the directory containing your images and depth maps.
**Usage**
1.	Open MATLAB and navigate to the directory containing the demo script.
2.	Run the script in the MATLAB Command Window. No additional arguments are required:
matlabCopy code
run('YourScriptName.m'); 
3.	The script will process each image and depth map pair in sequence, applying calculated orientation corrections.
4.	View the output images displayed by the script for visual verification of the orientation corrections.
**Functions Overview**
•	Main_angle_outer: Calculates the optimal orientation angle for a depth map based on gradient consistency and symmetry. Returns the angle for further adjustment.
**Troubleshooting**
•	Ensure all images and depth maps are correctly named and placed in the specified directory.
•	Verify that MATLAB's Image Processing Toolbox is installed and up to date.
•	Check for any path discrepancies or typos in the datapath variable.
